# Trip Panel

A simple panel with informations about the trip in progress.

It uses Leaflet map, OSM geolocation, Bulma Framework, and more...

Useful to give news about you to your family and friends when you are far from them.

You can find the (beta) version of my Trip Panel for my current trip to the USA here :

## Features

### Contact

The contact tiles contain links to social medias. Its reminds your grandmother you are not using e-mail anymore.

### Position

What it does now: Shows a preset location, it can't be automatically updated, you have to do it in the code. (Yes it's useless. It's BETA)

What it will do in the future: In the backend interface, you will be able to update your location when you want to do it.
I would love to add a feature wich let you switch in "preset" mode. You preset a certain destination for a certain time, and your pin icon will move gradually. 
Could be used when you are in a plane for instance.

### Planning

What it does now: Shows a preset list of events, can't do anything without touching code. Yeah, BETA again.

What it will do in the future: In the backend interface, you will be able to add, delete and edit events. They will be marked as "done" on the panel when the time is up.

### Bottom Tile What Is This Sh**

I don't know yet, but there will be something.
