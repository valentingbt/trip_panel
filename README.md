# Trip Panel

A simple panel with informations about the trip in progress.

It uses Leaflet map, OSM geolocation, Bulma Framework, and more...

Useful to give news about you to your family and friends when you are far from them.

You can find the (beta) version of my Trip Panel for my current trip to the USA here :
